I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Parallel Computing Systems (PCS) group within the Informatics Institute of University of Amsterdam, working on the EU-funded H2020 project ADMORPH. Prior to this, I received my Ph.D. in computer science from the Leiden Institude of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS) at Leiden University under supervision of Dr. Todor Stefanov in August 2020.
