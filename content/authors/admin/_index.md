Sobhan Niknam is a research fellow at [TNO-ESI](https://esi.nl) working on performance diagnostics of complex cyber-physical systems in high-tech industries. Prior to this, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Parallel Computing Systems (PCS)](https://pcs-research.nl) group within the Informatics Institute of University of Amsterdam where he worked under the supervision of [Prof.dr. Andy Pimentel](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/a.d.pimentel/) on the [ADMORPH](http://admorph.eu) project. He also received his Ph.D. in computer science from the [Leiden Institude of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS)](https://liacs.leidenuniv.nl) at Leiden University under the supervision of [Dr. Todor Stefanov](https://liacs.leidenuniv.nl/~stefanovtp/) in August 2020. <!--My research interests include, but are not limited to, system-level design of fault-tolerant, energy-efficient, and real-time multiprocessor embedded systems, parallel dataflow models of computation, and design space exploration. -->
